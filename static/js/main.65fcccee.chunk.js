Typically, there will be a simple html file with a largely empty body, although there will be at least one element that has an id property. We call this a "root" DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM. Applications built with React usually have a single root DOM node. Elsewhere in the project directory, outside of this html file, there will be a JavaScript file that contains html-like code, and this file will be the main entry point for the app. This JS file is considered a parent, and there may be other JS files that contain more html-like code that can be rendered into that parent. These other JS files will be children of the parent. There might be yet more JS files with more html-like code that gets rendered into the children; these are considered children of the children. And so it continues, and soon a tree is formed, with the initial JS file parent at the top, and children below, and children of children below that and so on.

Writing JS code that is supposed to result in html does not come naturally, and neither does it look pretty, and does not give us the neat and tidy indentations we get when we write pure html. To solve this problem, a syntax extension for JS was created called JSX (which stands for JavaScript XML), which allows us to write html directly into JS code, and is much more user friendly, and easier to read, write and debug. However, it should be kept in mind, you can forego JSX and write all your components in JS, although this is not recommended."}),Object(s.jsx)("p",{children:"So JSX makes it easy to use html in our JS code.

Let's imagine you are using REST APIs and that you need to make an API call to retrieve a particular user's first name, second name, and home town from a database. However, the API may be set up so that all calls return an object that includes not just the user's first name, second name, and home town, but also their age, weight, height, marital status and lots of other details that you have no interest in. You have no choice but to recieve this object that contains all this data that you do not need. This is called overfetching. Now let's say that in addition to finding out the first name, second name, and home town of a particular user, you also wish to find out the population of that home town.
