I\n                decided to make lemonade with 2020's lemons, and use the extra\n                free time to finally really get into the weeds of a hobby that\n                had always captivated me: programming.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                Although my previous work experience has been in recruitment,\n                and in teaching English as a foreign language, I knew there were\n                a lot of successful self-taught programmers out there. Like a\n                lot of people, I was already familiar with{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">HTML</span> and{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">CSS</span>, but in 2020 I started to\n                teach myself JavaScript for the first time, and quickly came to\n                appreciate the flexibility and power of the language.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                Once I had spent time learning{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">JavaScript</span> theory, such as{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">regular expressions</span>,{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">methods</span>,{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">algorithms</span>,{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">data-structures</span>, and{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">ES6</span>, I started to put this theory\n                into practice by adding JavaScript to HTML/CSS front-end\n                projects as a way to produce single-page web applications that\n                were responsive to user inputs. Of course, as is the tried and\n                tested and clichéd path, I built a{\" \"}\n                <a\n                  href=\"https://stephendoyle10.github.io/The-Queerculator/\"\n                  className=\"articleLink\"\n                  target=\"_blank\"\n                  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n                >\n                  calculator\n                </a>{\" \"}\n                first!

This is done using GitHub, and more specifically, their GitHub pages feature. There are a number of steps involved in this, which this article goes through. Also, be advised that for this to work you will need:<br/>\n        1. a GitHub account,<br/>\n        2. Node.js installed (check this by typing 'node --version' in the terminal),<br/>\n        3. git installed (check this by typing 'git --version' in the terminal)<br/>\n\n\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <h4>Step 1</h4>\n        <p>Navigate terminal to project directory</p>\n        <h4>Step 2</h4>\n        <p>On the GitHub website, on your profile, click on 'new repository'. Give the repository a name, click on 'public', although it is not necessary to give it a description or a readme now. Click on 'create'. The repository will be created and you will be redirected to a new page. Leave that page open and in the background for now, we will needing it later.</p>\n        <h4>Step 3</h4>\n        <p>Make sure the terminal is in the project folder, and then type 'npm install gh-pages --save-dev'. It will take a minute to install this package.</p>\n        <h4>Step 4</h4>\n        <p>In your IDE, open the project's package.json file. At the very beginning of the object, create a new key/value pair, like so: \"homepage\":\"http://&#123;github username&#125;.github.io/&#123;github repository name&#125;\"</p>\n        <h4>Step 5</h4>\n        <p>In the same package.json file you will need to add two key/value pairs at the top of the scripts object, like so: \"predeploy\":\"npm run build\",\n    \"deploy\":\"gh-pages -d build\"</p>\n        \n        \n        <h4>Step 5</h4>\n        <p>Back in terminal (make sure it is in the right folder) type 'git init' and enter.</p>\n        <p><span className=\"italic\">What does this do?</span>&nbsp;The git init command creates or initializes a new Git project, or repository. It creates a .git folder with all the tools and data necessary to maintain versions. This command only needs to be used once per project to complete the initial setup.</p>\n        \n\n        <h4>Step 6</h4>\n        <p>Still in the terminal, back in the browser on the github website, on the page you were redirected to when you created your repository, copy the full line that begins: 'git remote add origin...'. Paste this into the terminal and press enter.</p>\n        <p><span className=\"italic\">What does this do?</span>&nbsp;We have previously initialized the repository (step 5), and we also have a remote repository at GitHub.com. With step 6, we add the remote URL to our local git repository. This stores the remote URL under a more human-friendly name: origin. We will be using 'origin' in a subsequent step.</p>\n\n\n        <h4>Step 7</h4>\n        <p>Then type 'npm run deploy' and enter. (You may be asked for your GitHub username and password in the terminal)</p>\n        <p><span className=\"italic\">What does this do?</span> When you run 'npm run deploy', the scripts properties inside the package.json file are checked in order to decide what to do next. The \"predeploy\" script will run first: \"npm run build\". This builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified. So after 'npm run build' is performed for the first time, you'll notice that your locally-hosted project now has a build folder, which contains that is not very human-friendly, but it optimized for better performance.</p>\n        <p>After the predeploy script (ie \"npm run build\") is performed, the deploy script runs. This is \"gh-pages -d build\"</p>\n        \n        \n        <h4>Step 8</h4>\n        <p>In terminal, run 'git add .' and enter. This adds files from the working directory to the staging area</p>\n        <p>Then run 'git commit -m \"first deployment\" '. This permanently stores file changes from the staging area, and into the local repository.</p>\n        <p>Then run 'git push -u origin master'. This uploads local repository content to a remote repository. In this case, the remote repo is hosted on GitHub, but this could be hosted anywhere.</p>\n\n\n        <h4>Finished!</h4>\n        <p>If you go to your repository page now on GitHub, and go to settings, you should see a green box with info telling you where your project has been published online.</p>\n\n        <h2>Making changes and updating your project</h2>\n        <p>So the above steps are how to deploy your lovely new react app to the internet using GitHub. But of course, you'll be making changes to your app over time, and improving it. How should you update your changes?</p>\n        <p>On your GitHub repository for your react project there are two branches, the 'gh-pages' branch, and the 'master' branch. The 'master' branch is the same as the code you write on your IDE on your computer/ The 'gh-pages' branch is where this original code has been bundled, using Webpack, for optimal performance in production. Your app is deployed from here.</p>\n        <p>When you make changes to your code in your IDE to the locally stored files, these changes have to be updated to both the master branch and the gh-pages branch on your remote GitHub repository. To update the 'gh-pages' branch, type 'npm run deploy' in the terminal. The 'gh-pages' branch has now updated, and as the deployed app that you see online comes from here, these updates are also reflected in the app as you see it online.</p>\n        <p>HOWEVER, the master branch on GitHub has not been updated. To do this you must type the following three commands into the terminal:</p>\n        <p>git add .</p>\n        <p>git commit -m \"commit message\"</p>\n        <p>git push -u origin master</p>\n        <p>After following these steps, the updated code as it exists on your computer should be identical to the code on the master branch of your GitHub repo, while on the 'GH-pages' branch there will be a bundled build of these updates, and so your deployed app online will have the nexessary updates.</p>\n      \n        \n\n        \n        </div>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </Container>\n         \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default DeployingReact;","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./App.css\";\nimport \"bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\";\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\n\nclass Notes extends React.Component {\n  \n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Container>\n        <Row>\n          <Col md={{ span: 8, offset: 2 }}>\n            <div className=\"bodyContent\">\n                <h2 className=\"subheading\">Micro-articles</h2>\n                <br/>\n                \n                    <div className=\"articleTeaser\" >\n                <h5 >\n                <div className=\"plainP\">Note 1</div></h5>\n                <br/>\n                <p className=\"articleTeaserText\">Note 1 text</p>\n                </div>\n                \n                \n              \n            </div>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </Container>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Notes;","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"../App.css\";\nimport \"bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\";\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from \"react-bootstrap\";\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\n\n\nclass AsyncJSArticle extends React.Component {\n\n  render() {\n    const articleName = \"Asynchronous Javascript\";\n    return (\n      \n        <Container>\n        <Row>\n          <Col md={{ span: 8, offset: 2 }}>\n            <div className=\"bodyContent\">\n        <p><Link as={Link} className=\"plainP\" to=\"/articles\">Articles</Link > > {articleName}</p>\n        <br/>\n        <h3 className=\"subheading\">{articleName}</h3>\n        <br/>\n        <p className=\"publishedDate\">20 Jan 2021</p>\n        <p>Aysynchronous JavaScript touches on a lot of different concepts, such as callback functions, higher order functions, ‘callback hell’, single- vs multi-threaded code, I/O blocking/non-blocking, the Javascript runtime, the event loop, the call stack, task queue, promises, async/await, web apis, and node apis. It can seem overwhelming, however the aim of the following article is to explain all these concepts and show how they all fit together.</p>\n        <br />\n        <h4>What is asynchronous programming and why is it important in web development?</h4>\n        <p>Let’s say you are looking for cheap hotel rooms for your holiday, and you use a website like Trivago that compares prices from hundreds of different sites. You enter in your trip dates and preferred location and when you click submit, Trivago gets to work trawling these hundreds of other websites for the best deals. It will likely take a number of seconds for this request to complete, and to retrieve the requested data.</p>\n        <p>Now, if the website makes a synchronous request, the execution of further code will be blocked until the request is completed and the required data is retrieved, which causes the website to freeze. Not good. But if the website makes an asynchronous request, the browser can continue to execute other code and work as normal, while the request is being completed in the background.  With asynchronous programming, JavaScript can run parts of tasks and continue to other tasks while the previous tasks complete; it does not have to wait for each individual task to complete before moving on to the next one.</p>\n        <br />\n        <h4>Is JavaScript an aynchronous language?</h4>\n        <p>JavaScript is a <span className=\"bold\">single-threaded</span> language, which means no two bits of script can run at the same time (contrast with Java or C#, which are <span className=\"bold\">multi-threaded</span> so can run different pieces of script parallel with each other). This means, by default, and at its core, Javascript is a synchronous language. However, JavaScript can also be made to work asynchronously, which is what makes it so efficient and powerful for both frontend and backend web development, and means a website built with JavaScript doesn’t freeze when, for example, performing an API request.</p>\n        <p>Asynchronous javascript has gone through various stages of development over the years, becoming more and more refined and sophisticated. The earliest way to achieve asynchronous JavaScript was with the use of <span className=\"bold\">callback functions</span>, although, as we will see, this had its problems, and often resulted in code that was difficult to write, read and debug. <span className=\"bold\">Promises</span>, a more elegant way to enable asynchronous JavaScript, was integrated in the ES6/ECMA2015 JavaScript revision. Promises made asynchronous JavaScript code more pleasant to read and write, and in the ES8/ECMA2017 JavaScript revision, more syntactic sugar was added to these promises, with the addition of the ‘<span className=\"bold\">async...await</span>’ syntax.</p>\n        <br />\n        <h4>Callback functions</h4>\n        <p>Sometimes a function will take another function as one of its parameters. In this case, the function that takes the function as a parameter is called a <span className=\"bold\">higher order function</span>, whereas the function that is used as an argument in the higher order function is called a <span className=\"bold\">callback function</span>. Many callback functions are synchronous/ blocking, like Javascript in general. However, often callbacks are used to continue code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed — these are called asynchronous callbacks.</p>\n        <p>The simplest way to do this is with the setTimeout() method. setTimeout() takes a functions as an argument - ie a callback function. Look at the following code:</p>\n        <pre><code>console.log(“hello”);<br />console.log(“goodbye);</code></pre>\n        <br />\n        <p>When this is run, the following will be logged to the console:</p>\n        <pre><code>hello<br />goodbye</code></pre>\n        <p>Both methods are blocking (which means they block the running of subsequent code until they have finished), and run synchronously, from top to bottom.</p>\n        <p>Now look at the following code:</p>\n        <pre><code>setTimeout(()=&gt;{\"{\"}console.log(\"hello\"){\"}\"}, 1000); <br />console.log(“goodbye\");</code></pre>\n        <p>In this code, console.log(“hello\") is now an anonymous callback function inside the setTimeout method, and this method has been told not to execute the callback for 1000 ms (1 second). setTimeout method is non-blocking; when it is called, the operation is taken over by the browser, leaving JavaScript to run any subsequent code. The browser/web API takes care of the countdown timer of 1000ms, and when the timer is up, the callback function joins the call stack (via the task queue and the event loop) to be carried out by the JavaScript interpreter. Ultimately, when this code is run, the following will be logged to the console:</p>\n        <pre><code>goodbye<br />hello</code></pre>\n        <p>Node.JS runs on similar principles, and makes heavy use of callback functions. When the higher order function is first called, the operation is offloaded to the system kernel, until it is complete, then passed back to the call stack (via the task queue and event loop) to be carried out by the JavaScript interpreter.</p>\n        <p>For example:</p>\n        <pre><code>findData(database,(err, result)=&gt;{\"{\"}<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;displayResults(result){\"}\"}) </code></pre>\n        <p>Here, findData() is a method that fetches data from a database. When this is called, the operation is offloaded to the system kernel, which proceeds to retrieve the requested data, while JavaScript is freed up to execute any subsequent code in the process. When the data has been successfully retrieved, the operation is passed back to JavaScript to execute the callback [displayResults(result)], which displays results on the webpage.</p>\n        <p>It is probably helpful to see this explained in Node's own words. This is taken from their own <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/\">documentation</a>:</p>\n        <blockquote>The event loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations — despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded — by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible. Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background. When one of these operations completes, the kernel tells Node.js so that the appropriate callback may be added to the poll queue to eventually be executed.</blockquote>\n        <br />\n        <h4>Promises, and Async/Await</h4>\n        <p>Callbacks work fine for small operations, but when a project becomes more ambitions, it will likely start to have callbacks within callbacks within callbacks, and so on. For example, your project may make a request to a database, and use the returned data to make another request, and use the returned data of that request to make another request, and so on. This results in something that has been nicknamed the ‘pyramid of doom’, or ‘callback hell’, and it results in code that is difficult to write, read, and debug.</p>\n        <p>Promises were implemented in ES6/ECMA 2015 in order to tackle the problem of callback hell. With promises, asynchronous code can be written to look like synchronous code ie neatly aligned vertically, rather than being nested and lurching ever further to the right. The advantage of this is that synchronous code always looks more natural and intuitive to human eyes, and easier to read, write and debug, than asynchronous code.</p>\n        <p>With ES8/ECMA2017, Async/ Await syntax was implemented. This is just syntactic sugar for Promises, meaning it doesn’t introduce any new functionality. The main benefit is that with async/ await, one can write asynchronous code, yet it looks even more like synchronous code and eliminates nesting, making it is easier to read, write and debug (as asynchronous code is often counter-intuitive and difficult to read).</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>Further reading:</p>\n        <p>MDN Web Docs: Concurency model and the event loop:</p>\n        <p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop</a></p>\n        <br />\n        <p>Video of Philip Robert’s famous presentation ‘What the heck is the event loop anyway?’:</p>\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ</a></p>\n        </div>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </Container>\n         \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default AsyncJSArticle;","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"../App.css\";\nimport \"bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\";\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from \"react-bootstrap\";\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\n\n\nclass EnginesAndRuntime extends React.Component {\n  \n\n  render() {\n    const articleName = \"Engines and Runtime Environments\";\n    return (\n      \n        <Container>\n        <Row>\n          <Col md={{ span: 8, offset: 2 }}>\n            <div className=\"bodyContent\">\n        <p><Link as={Link} className=\"plainP\" to=\"/articles\">Articles</Link > > {articleName}</p>\n        <br/>\n        <h3 className=\"subheading\">{articleName}</h3>\n        <br/>\n        <p className=\"publishedDate\">05 Feb 2021</p>\n        <p>A runtime engine is a program or interpreter that reads code, translates it into machine code, and executes it. It takes human-readable code (ie high level code) such as JavaScript, and converts it to low-level machine code. There are numerous engines for JavaScript. For example, Google Chrome has V8, while Firefox has Spider-Monkey. These engines are a key feature of a runtime environment, which is part of the web browser.</p>\n        <p>An engine is necessary to execute JavaScript code, and as JavaScript is the frontend language of web development, this is why every browser has a JavaScript runtime environment (which includes an engine). Google Chrome's JavaScript engine is one of the more popular engines. It is called V8, it is written in C++, and is open source. </p>\n        {/* \n        Difference between compiled and interpreted languages:\n        The difference between a compiler and an interpreter is similar to the difference between a human language interpreter and a human translator.\n\n        An interpreter goes over the program line by line, translates it, runs it, and then gets the next line. That is like an interpreter that translates sentences one at a time as they're said.\n\n        A compiler takes the whole program, translates it all and then outputs a machine-readable code. That is like sending your article to be translated and getting it back all in French.\n\n        Each method has advantages and disadvantages. If the code is compiled, then any computer can instantly run it without worrying about translating it making it faster, and meaning it needs to only be translated once no matter how many times it is run. Also the user will not have access to the original code. An interpreted program doesn't have to be saved on the computer and lines can be executed one at a time from a different medium, and can also give you accurate information regarding which line did what / had an error / etc.*/}\n        <p>So why has JavaScript traditionally been only used on the frontend? As just discussed, Javascript needs a runtime environment, and an engine (which is part of that environment), to interpret and then execute JavaScript code. These runtime environments were traditionally found on browsers, and their purpose was to interpret frontend code (eg JavaScript code to make websites interactive and manipulate the DOM). However, the browser's JavaScript runtime environment could not be used to interpret and execute server-side/ backend code - in web development, backend/ server side code is separate and runs independently of the browser. Node's innovation was to create it's own runtime environment, using V8 as the engine, so that JavaScript code could be executed on the server side. In addition to the V8 engine, the Node runtime environment also includes modules and APIs that give extra functionality to JavaScript code.\n        </p>\n        \n        <p></p>\n        <p></p>\n        <p></p>\n        <p></p>\n        <p></p>\n        <p></p>\n        \n        \n        </div>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </Container>\n         \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default EnginesAndRuntime;","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"../App.css\";\nimport \"bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\";\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from \"react-bootstrap\";\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\n\n\nclass ComponentTypes extends React.Component {\n  \n\n  render() {\n    const articleName = \"React Component Types\";\n    return (\n      \n        <Container>\n        <Row>\n          <Col md={{ span: 8, offset: 2 }}>\n            <div className=\"bodyContent\">\n        <p><Link as={Link} className=\"plainP\" to=\"/articles\">Articles</Link > > {articleName}</p>\n        <br/>\n        <h3 className=\"subheading\">{articleName}</h3>\n        <br/>\n        <p className=\"publishedDate\">10 Feb 2021</p>\n        <p>The topic of React components touches on a lot of different concepts, such as stateful and stateless components, function components, and class components. Meanwhile, the arrival of Hooks in 2018 changed everything. What do all these things mean, and how do they fit into each other. It can be a bit tricky to understand all these concepts and grasp how they all fit into one another. This article aims to help with that!</p>\n        <h4>Function Components</h4>\n        <p>Function components used to be called functional stateless components, or more simply stateless components, because - big surprise - it used to be impossible for them to contain state. However, since React 16.8 in 2018 and the introduction of Hooks, function components have now received an upgrade, and can now contain state. Before the introduction of Hooks, however, function components were used for components that did not require state. For example, function components can be used for parts of a website that would never have to change based on user input. For example, it is common for visual artists to create simple portfolio websites that are entirely static website. This could happily be composed of all function stateless components. Another almost notorious example is the simple <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com\" className=\"articleLink\" target=\"_blank\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">website</a> for the multi-billion dollar company Berkshire Hathaway, that hasn't had an upgrade in almost 20 years. Again, there is no need for anything other than stateless function components for this website.</p>\n        <p>A simple function component would look like this:</p>\n        <pre><code>function HelloWorld() {\"{\"}<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return &lt;h1&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h1&gt;{\"}\"} </code></pre>\n        <h4>Class Components</h4>\n        <p>The syntax for a class component is a bit more complex. If the above code example for a function component were to be written as a class component it would look like this:</p>\n        <p>The advantage of class components used to be that they could take state. This means a class component can be modified and updated based on user input. A simple example of this is the humble 'to do list' app, that most beginner programmers have tackled at some point or other! When a user inputs a new list item, and then click submit, no doubt that item will be added to another component. This is done by updating the state of that component.</p>\n        <p>That was the benefit of class components compared to function components. The downside was that the syntax for class components is a bit more complex than for function components. The above function component would look like this if written as a class component:</p>\n        <pre><code>class HelloWorld extends React.Component {\"{\"}\n        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;render(){\"{\"}\n        <br/>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return &lt;h1&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h1&gt;;\n        <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{\"}\"} \n        <br/>{\"}\"}</code></pre>\n        \n        <h4>Hooks</h4>\n        <p>It is not really very difficult to learn how to create function components and class components, or to learn when one or the other should be used. However, the process is even simpler now, as since the introuction of Hooks in 2018 with React 16.8, there is no longer any need for class components, as function components can now take state.</p>\n\n        <p>Further reading:</p>\n        <p>Making Sense of React Hooks: React employee Dan Abramov explains the reasons why Hooks was necessary:</p>\n        <p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889\">https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889</a></p>\n        <br />\n        \n        \n        </div>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </Container>\n         \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ComponentTypes;","import React from 'react';\n\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\nimport Home from './Home';\nimport NavBar from './NavBar';\nimport About from './About';\nimport Projects from './Projects';\nimport Articles from './Articles';\nimport Resources from './Resources';\nimport Contact from './Contact';\nimport DeployingReact from './ArticlesComponents/DeployingReact';\nimport Notes from './Notes';\nimport AsyncJSArticle from \"./ArticlesComponents/AsnycJSArticle\";\nimport EnginesAndRuntime from \"./ArticlesComponents/EnginesAndRuntime\";\nimport ComponentTypes from \"./ArticlesComponents/ComponentTypes\";\nimport { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nconst App=()=>{\n\n  return(\n    <div>\n      <NavBar/>\n      \n      <Switch>\n          <Route path=\"/\" component={Home} exact />\n          <Route path=\"/about\" component={About} />\n          <Route path=\"/projects\" component={Projects} />\n          <Route path=\"/articles\" component={Articles} />\n          <Route path=\"/resources\" component={Resources} />\n          <Route path=\"/contact\" component={Contact} />\n          <Route path=\"/asyncjsarticle\" component={AsyncJSArticle}/>\n          <Route path=\"/deployingreact\" component={DeployingReact}/>\n          <Route path=\"/enginesandruntime\" component={EnginesAndRuntime}/>\n          <Route path=\"/componenttypes\" component={ComponentTypes}/>\n          <Route path=\"/notes\" component={Notes}/>\n\n\n         \n      </Switch>\n        \n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import { PureComponent } from \"react\";\nimport { withRouter } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nclass ScrollIntoView extends PureComponent {\n  componentDidMount = () => window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n\n  componentDidUpdate = prevProps => {\n    if (this.props.location !== prevProps.location) window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  };\n\n  render = () => this.props.children;\n}\n\nexport default withRouter(ScrollIntoView);","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { HashRouter} from 'react-router-dom';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport ScrollIntoView from './ScrollIntoView';\n\n\n//The purpose of ScrollIntoView is to fix a routing bug in which when you click on a new page, the new page loads but will not automatically start the new page at the top.
