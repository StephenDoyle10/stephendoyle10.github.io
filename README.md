This is my personal portfolio webiste where I host information about my programming background, information and links to my finsihed projects, and articles I have written about various aspects of computer science and programming that interest me. This is a static website that I originally created in the traditional way - with HTML and CSS (with a little help from Bootstrap and Sass). However, after learning React, one of my very first React projects was to refactor this website and build it in React. So the website as you see it now is built in React. This was a great exercise to start thinking of websites in the React way, which is a major paradigm shift from from how we traditionally view building websites. Also, this website gave me important practice in using packages such as react-router and react-bootstrap.
