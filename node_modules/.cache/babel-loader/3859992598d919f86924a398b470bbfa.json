freeCodeCamp is an amazing free online course that I used early\n                on in my coding journey. By the time I discovered freeCodeCamp I\n                was already familiar with HTML and CSS, so I skipped the first\n                module, and went straight to 'JavaScript Algorithms and Data\n                Structures'. This was a revelation, I still return to certain\n                sections as a refresher and to test myself. The following\n                freeCodeCamp modules are not as detailed as its JavaScript one,\n                but are still useful introductions to topics such as Bootstrap,\n                Sass, D3, React and Node.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <p className=\"mediaName\">Codecademy</p>\n              <a\n                className=\"articleLink\"\n                href=\"https://www.codecademy.com\"\n                target=\"_blank\"\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n              >\n                https://www.codecademy.com\n              </a>\n              <p>\n                Codecademy has a huge catalogue of topics and courses, although\n                most of the content is for paid subscribers only.
