That is like an interpreter that translates sentences one at a time as they're said.\n\n        A compiler takes the whole program, translates it all and then outputs a machine-readable code. That is like sending your article to be translated and getting it back all in French.\n\n        Each method has advantages and disadvantages. If the code is compiled, then any computer can instantly run it without worrying about translating it making it faster, and meaning it needs to only be translated once no matter how many times it is run. Also the user will not have access to the original code. An interpreted program doesn't have to be saved on the computer and lines can be executed one at a time from a different medium, and can also give you accurate information regarding which line did what / had an error / etc.*/}\n        <p>So why has JavaScript traditionally been only used on the frontend?
