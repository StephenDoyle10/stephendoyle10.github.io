With\n                quarantines, lockdowns, self-isolations, and all that kind of\n                fun stuff, most of us had a lot of free time on our hands. I\n                decided to make lemonade with 2020's lemons, and use the extra\n                free time to finally really get into the weeds of a hobby that\n                had always captivated me: programming.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                Although my previous work experience has been in recruitment,\n                and in teaching English as a foreign language, I knew there were\n                a lot of successful self-taught programmers out there. Like a\n                lot of people, I was already familiar with{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">HTML</span> and{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">CSS</span>, but in 2020 I started to\n                teach myself JavaScript for the first time, and quickly came to\n                appreciate the flexibility and power of the language.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                Once I had spent time learning{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">JavaScript</span> theory, such as{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">regular expressions</span>,{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">methods</span>,{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">algorithms</span>,{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">data-structures</span>, and{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">ES6</span>, I started to put this theory\n                into practice by adding JavaScript to HTML/CSS front-end\n                projects as a way to produce single-page web applications that\n                were responsive to user inputs. Of course, as is the tried and\n                tested and clichéd path, I built a{\" \"}\n                <a\n                  href=\"https://stephendoyle10.github.io/The-Queerculator/\"\n                  className=\"articleLink\"\n                  target=\"_blank\"\n                  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n                >\n                  calculator\n                </a>{\" \"}\n                first! Next came an interactive javaScript string method{\" \"}\n                <a\n                  href=\"https://stephendoyle10.github.io/JS-String-Methods/\"\n                  className=\"articleLink\"\n                  target=\"_blank\"\n                  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n                >\n                  cheat sheet\n                </a>\n                , and then a{\" \"}\n                <a\n                  href=\"https://stephendoyle10.github.io/UK-Salary-Calculator/\"\n                  className=\"articleLink\"\n                  target=\"_blank\"\n                  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n                >\n                  UK Salary Calculator\n                </a>\n                .\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                The next challenge was to turn my hand to{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">full-stack development</span>, and, in\n                particular, to use technologies such as{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">Node.js</span>,{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">Express</span> and{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">MongoDB</span>. I decided to combine my\n                twin loves of programming and board gaming to build my first\n                full-stack project using these technologies. This was a web app\n                called{\" \"}\n                <a\n                  href=\"https://boarpp.herokuapp.com\"\n                  className=\"articleLink\"\n                  target=\"_blank\"\n                  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n                >\n                  Boarpp\n                </a>\n                : a social media project for baordgamers to share\n                boardgame-related texts, pictures and links, and discuss them\n                with other users.\n                <br /> <br />\n                Happy with my progress in Node, next I wanted to start building{\" \"}\n                <span className=\"bold\">React</span> projects. After completing\n                an online course, my first practical project was to refactor my\n                portfolio website from being a traditional HTML, CSS and JS\n                project into being a React project. I successfully achieved\n                this, and the website you are currently viewing is built with\n                the magic of React! The challenge I am currently working on is\n                to build a MERN stack project - in other words, a full-stack\n                project built with MongoDB, Express, React and Node.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </Container>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default About;\n\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
