This is done by updating the state of that component.</p>\n        <p>That was the benefit of class components, over the function components. The downside was that the syntax for class components is a bit more complex than for function components. The above function component would look like this if written as a class component:</p>\n        <pre><code>class HelloWorld extends React.Component {\"{\"}\n        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;render(){\"{\"}\n        <br/>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return &lt;h1&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h1&gt;;\n        <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{\"}\"} \n        <br/>{\"}\"}</code></pre>\n        <h4>Props</h4>\n        <p></p>\n        <h4>State - Stateless and Stateful Components</h4>\n        <p></p>\n        <h4>Hooks</h4>\n        <p>It is not really very difficult to learn how to create function components and class components, or to learn when one or the other should be used. However, the process is even simpler now, as since the introuction of Hooks in 2018 with React 16.8, there is no longer any need for class components, as function components can now take state.</p>\n\n        <p>Further reading:</p>\n        <p>Making Sense of React Hooks: React employee Dan Abramov explains the reasons why Hooks was necessary:</p>\n        <p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889\">https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889</a></p>\n        <br />\n        \n        \n        </div>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </Container>\n         \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ComponentTypes;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
